					<p class="paragraph-1"><span>Here's everything you need to know here at this link. Summary? If you have cable, there's no shortage of options for you: the VMAs will be broadcast live on several Viacom channels including MTV, MTV2, VH1, BET, and Comedy Central. You can also stream the show online on MTV.com.</p>
					<br>
					<p class="paragraph-2"><span>But what if you don't have cable? Don't worryâ€“watching the VMAs is trickier, but not impossible. MTV and its associated channels are available on several live TV streaming services, including Philo, fuboTV, Sling TV, and DirecTV Now. These services all offer a 7-day free trial, so you don't need to commit upfront. But be aware that in some cases you may need to sign up for an additional bundle in order to get these channels.</p>
